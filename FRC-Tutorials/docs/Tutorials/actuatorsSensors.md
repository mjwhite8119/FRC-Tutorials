# Actuators and Sensors

### What Physical Quantities Are Sensable?

**Spatial**: displacement, velocity, acceleration, distance to something, proximity, position, attitude, area, volume, level/tilt, motion detection
**Temporal**: clock, chronometer (elapsed time), frequency.
**Electromagnetic**: voltage, current, power, charge, capacitance, inductance, magnetic
field, light intensity, color. These may operate within a circuit or within open space.
**Mechanical**: solid (mass, weight, density, force, strain, torque), fluid (acoustic, pressure, flow, viscosity), thermal (temperature), calories.
**Other**: chemical (composition, pH, humidity, pollution, ozone), radiation (nuclear),
biomedical (blood flow, pressure).
